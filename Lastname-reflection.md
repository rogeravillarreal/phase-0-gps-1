# What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I would say I was and still kind of struggling with the GitHub workflow. I feel that I am missing something and cannot connect the dots of the workflow entirely.

# What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
Most of the concept was about the Git workflow and the Github procedures.

# What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I mainly asked about the workflow of GitHub. There are still many questions I need to be answered unfortunaley... :(

# What still confuses you about Git?
Mainly the way it connects with GitHub and from there on.

# How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I think it went well, but I feel as if I was not very helpful. I felt that I was lagging in knowledge and confused about the GitHub...
