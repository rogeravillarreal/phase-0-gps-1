**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
I think I was having some difficulty with keeping straight the git commands since I didn't understand all their components.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
I think I gained a much clearer idea of how real git workflow might look like. It was very helpful to troubleshoot and collaborate with multiple people and see what it was like to pass code back and forth.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
What does the -b flag mean in the git checkout command? Do you feel okay with what we've done so far/are you ready to move forward? What would be your recommendation for this?

**What still confuses you about Git?**
I'm a bit confused about how collaborators work. At first, I was the navigator and as such was made a collaborator. But when it was my turn to drive, I just cloned the repo and worked on my own copy. It's unclear to me what the benefit of being a collaborator is.

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
I had a positive experience! I think it was very helpful to have a guide since this structure of paired programming is so new.
